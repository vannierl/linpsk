Important: This version uses qt5 !!!




*****************************************************************************
To build linpsk, untar the tar archiv and switch to the linpsk directory.
*****************************************************************************

run:
mkdir -p build
cd build
qmake -o Makefile ../linpsk.pro
make




The executable linpsk is build in the build  directory.

make install 

will install the binary into usr/local/bin and the desktop file into /usr/share/pixmaps/ and the icon file into /usr/share/pixmaps/ .

LinPSK uses the alsa sound system.
You can use valid alsa devices like plughw:1 in the settings dialog
Also using the card name is possible. In this case LinPSK searches the cardnumber and opens
plughw:[cardnumber]

If you prefer to use LinPSK_Record and LinPSK_Play as in previous versions edit the file asoundrc in the linpsk directory appropriately and append it to .asoundrc in your homedirectory.
If no .asoundrc exists copy the edited asoundrc to .asoundrc in your homedirectory instead of appending.

*****************************************************************************
debug mode with gdb:
*****************************************************************************

cd to the build directory and clean it by
            rm -rf *
            Then run
            qmake ../linpsk.pro 
            make -f Makefile.debug
            gdb linpsk
gdb:
enter r to run
bt for backtrace.
